Rubik Cube
==========

The project explores and compares algorithms for solving the
Pocket Cube (2x2x2 Rubik's Cube). The investigation involves
implementing A* and Bidirectional BFS algorithms, along with
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) using Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) for heuristic evaluation. Additionally, a pattern database
is constructed to enhance efficiency in solving the cube. The team
evaluates and compares these approaches based on execution time,
states explored, and path length, presenting insightful observations
on their performance.
